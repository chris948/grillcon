Python code for a raspberry pi grill controller.

The temperature hardware is a dual MAX31856 board for a meat and grill 
probe. Wired up a simple transistor for a 5v fan.

I wired up a i2c_8574 2 line LCD screen to 
display the IP address assigned in the event of 
DHCP.

Data logging in a SQLite database for 
temperatures, google charts displays the selected 
cook.
